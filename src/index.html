        <h1>Alone</h1>
        <h2>Edgar Allan Poe</h2>
        <h3>1809 –1849</h3>
        <p>From childhood’s hour I have not been
          As others were—I have not seen
          As others saw—I could not bring
          My passions from a common spring—
          From the same source I have not taken
          My sorrow—I could not awaken
          My heart to joy at the same tone—
          And all I lov’d—I lov’d alone—
          Then—in my childhood—in the dawn
          Of a most stormy life—was drawn
          From ev’ry depth of good and ill
          The mystery which binds me still—
          From the torrent, or the fountain—
          From the red cliff of the mountain—
          From the sun that ‘round me roll’d
          In its autumn tint of gold—
          From the lightning in the sky
          As it pass’d me flying by—
          From the thunder, and the storm—
          And the cloud that took the form
          (When the rest of Heaven was blue)
          Of a demon in my view—
        </p>
